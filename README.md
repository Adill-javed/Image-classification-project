Overview
This project implements an Image Classification system. The model is trained to classify images into predefined categories based on their visual features. The system can be applied to various domains, including healthcare, retail, and environmental monitoring.

Features
Preprocessing: Automated resizing, normalization, and augmentation of input images.
Model Training: Utilizes state-of-the-art neural networks (e.g., ResNet, VGG, MobileNet).
Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Prediction: Classify new images with a user-friendly interface or command-line tool.
Visualization: Display training curves and sample predictions with heatmaps.
